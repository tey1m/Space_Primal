3. Primal Survival Pixel

	Game Preview:
	    Our character is sent to space to colonise one of the planets.
	    Character is provided with some resources with which they can start
	    the colonization.

	    Initial items:
	        - Seeds
	        - Farming tools

	    Sadly, the spaceship the character travelled with is broken. Character
	    needs to get some materials from the meteors flying around to be able
	    to travel back home or to travel to other planets.

	    Character is also expected to make a shelter so that they are not cold.
	    Their oxygen mask is running out too which can only be fueled up in
	    the shelter. Character is also expected to make tools appropriate for
	    meteor fishing. Materials can be found on the surface of the planet and
	    from mining process. That being said, our character is also expected to
	    make mines and go under the ground.

	    Character can trade some items and valuables with the aliens that visit
	    him from time to time.
